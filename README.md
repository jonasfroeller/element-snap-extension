# Element Snap

A lightweight, reliable Chrome extension to capture pixel-perfect screenshots of any HTML element.

## Why Element Snap?

Unlike other extensions that re-render HTML to an image (often breaking styles), Element Snap takes a screenshot of the visible page. This guarantees that what you see is *exactly* what you get.

This approach is:
* **Reliable:** Preserves 100% of the element's styling, layout, and fonts.
* **Lightweight:** Built with zero libraries-, just vanilla JavaScript and the Chrome API for maximum speed.

> The only trade-off is that the element must be fully visible in the viewport to be captured.

## Features

* **Pixel-Perfect Capture:** Get a flawless image of any hovered element.
* **Live Padding Controls:** Add uniform or per-side padding with a real-time preview.
* **Flexible Output:** Save as PNG, JPG, WEBP, or SVG. Adjust quality for lossy formats.
* **Element Hiding:** Temporarily hide surrounding elements with a keypress (`H`) for a clean shot.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Capture (`Ctrl/Cmd+Click`), lock focus (`L`), and more for a fast workflow.

## How to Use

1.  **Activate:** Click the extension icon in your toolbar to turn it on for the current tab.
2.  **Hover:** Move your mouse to highlight the desired element.
3.  **Adjust:** Use the floating panel to change padding, format, and other settings.
4.  **Capture:** `Ctrl/Cmd + Click` the element or press the "Capture" button.
